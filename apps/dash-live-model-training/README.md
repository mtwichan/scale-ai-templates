### How to use the app

The demo app shows how the viewer works by simulating the training process of a few basic models. If you want to use the full app with your own model, follow theses steps:

1. Import the helper functions, `add_eval()` and `write_data()` from `tfutils.py`.
2. Use `add_eval()` to add the accuracy and cross-entropy operations in your tensorflow graph, if they are not already present. It takes as input `y_`, the Tensor containing the true target, aka labels, and `y`, which contains the predicted targets, aka logits. It will return two variables, accuracy and cross_entropy.
3. Create a feed dictionary ([read more about it here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.0/programmers_guide/reading_data)) for both your training and validation batch.
4. At every step, after running the session once, call `write_data()` to write the data in the log file. Use the feed dicts, _accuracy_ and _cross_entropy_ generated in the previous steps as input. If the output log file is renamed, update the _LOGFILE_ variable inside `app.py` as well to reflect the changes.
5. Run `app.py`, and open the given link.

Make sure that you correctly clone the repo with all the required libraries. You also need the latest version of Tensorflow and Sci-kit Learn.

## About the app

### What does the app do?

For the majority of Deep Learning models, it is extremely helpful to keep track of the accuracy and loss as it is training. At the moment, the best application to do that is [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard), which is a collection of visualization tools (metrics plots, image examples, graph representation, weight histogram, etc.) useful to debug and monitor the training of your model.

_Dash's Live Model Training Viewer_ is a compact visualization app that monitors core metrics of your **Tensorflow model** during training. It complements the Tensorboard by offering the following:

- **Real-time visualization**: The app is designed to visualize your metrics as they are updated inside your model.
- **Small and Lightweight**: The viewer loads a small number of important visualization, so that it loads and runs quickly.
- **Simple to use**: For simpler tensorflow models, all you need to do is to call `add_eval` to add the accuracy and cross entropy operations in the graph, and generate a log of the metrics using `write_data`. Both functions are inside `tfutils.py`, and examples are included in the `examples` directory.
- **Easy to modify**: The app is stored inside one module, and is written in under 400 lines. You can quickly modify and improve the app without breaking anything.
- **Plotly Graphs and Dash Integration**: Easily integrate the app into more complex Dash Apps, and includes all the tools found in Plotly graphs.

At the moment, the logging only works for iterative Tensorflow models. We are planning to extend it for PyTorch. You are encouraged to port the logging function (which is a simple csv logging) to Keras, Tensorflow's high-level API, MXNet, etc.
