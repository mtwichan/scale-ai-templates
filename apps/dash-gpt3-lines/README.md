## OpenAI GPT-3 API Access

In order to obtain access to the GPT-3 API, you will need to [join the waitlist](https://beta.openai.com/). Once you have the API,  you can find the secret key in [the quickstart](https://beta.openai.com/developer-quickstart), and export it as an environment variable:
```
export OPENAI_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxx"
```
Where "xxxxxxxxxxx" corresponds to your secret key.
